# nx-openapi-codegen

Built on top of [Kubb](https://www.kubb.dev), **nx-openapi-codegen** transforms an OpenAPI spec into a fully scoped NX monorepo for your GitHub organization or repository. Provide a URL or local path to your spec, and instantly generate.

## Note

This is useful for now, but if it were to be a real CLI, there would be a ton of things to change - there is a checklist for this in [docs/todo.md](docs/todo.md). Hard dependencies on nx should be reconsidered for example.

## Autogenerated SDKs

- **TypeScript Types**
- **Mocks**
  - **Faker** mocks (constant or randomized)
  - **MSW** handlers (constant or randomized responses)
- **HTTP Clients**
  - [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
  - [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
  - [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)
  - [TanStack React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview)
- **Validation**
  - [Zod schemas](https://zod.dev/)
- **Definitions**
  - OpenAPI Schema JSON definitions

You’ll also get **publishable GitHub npm packages** for TypeScript (publishing setup is currently limited to TypeScript), and optional Swift & Kotlin (Android) scaffolds are available for multi-platform projects (publishing not yet configured).

## Automatic GitHub Workflows

By default, the tool creates helpful GitHub Actions workflows to streamline development:

- **main.yml**:
  Runs on pushes to `main` (basic CI steps).
- **pull-request.yml**:
  Validates pull requests (linting, code generation, docs).
- **release.yml**:
  Manually triggers (via `workflow_dispatch`) for publishing TypeScript packages.
- **update-models.yml**:
  Periodically regenerates all models and opens a pull request with any changes—perfect for remote specs that update often.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js >= 22](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  (Recommended to manage versions with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

## Usage

```bash
npx nx-openapi-codegen
```

Follow the interactive prompts to specify your GitHub organization, repository, and OpenAPI spec path (remote or local). **nx-openapi-codegen** will take care of the rest—so you can focus on building applications, not boilerplate.
