# nx-openapi-codegen

Built on top of [Kubb](https://www.kubb.dev), nx-openapi-codegen transforms an OpenAPI spec into a fully scoped NX monorepo for your GitHub organization or repository. Simply provide a URL or local path to your OpenAPI spec, and enjoy a streamlined, automated setup with:

- **Autogenerated SDKs** featuring:
  - TypeScript types
  - Faker mocks
  - MSW handlers
  - Zod schemas
  - And more
- **Publishable GitHub npm packages** for TypeScript (publishing is fully supported)
- **Optional scaffolding** for Swift and Kotlin (Android) code (publishing not set up for these yet)

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js >= 22](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Recommended: [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

## Usage

```sh
npx nx-openapi-codegen
```

Follow the interactive prompts to specify your GitHub organization, repository, and OpenAPI spec path.
